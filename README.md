OVERVIEW
========

Bash script pipelines to complete an RNAseq differential expression analysis. Each directory contains scripts with alternative implementations of various parts of the pipeline. To run, create a script which ```source```es the file containing the implementation of each step you require, and run the function with the step name. See example.sh for an example.
